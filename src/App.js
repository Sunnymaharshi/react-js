React JS 
    It is a Javascript Library for web and native user interfaces.
    React is fast because it does efficient DOM manipulation 
    It uses Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber) to check diff of old and new virtual DOMs
    and then it updates actual DOM
    Library
        collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks
        it only focuses on specific functionality
        you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library
        we can use react inside small portion of page i.e. inside root node
        we can add it to existing page
        it doesn't change anything outside of root node 
    Framework 
        set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications
        it inlcudes almost everything u needed to develop the app
        framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, 
        but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
    web 
        react and react-dom let you build apps in react for web browsers 
    native
        React Native and Expo let you build apps in React for Android, iOS, and more. 
        They look and feel native because their UIs are truly native.
        It’s not a web view, your React components render real Android and iOS views provided by the platform.
    
    Adding React to the project
        using CDN 
            add React and ReactDOM cdn links at end of body tag
            react.js file contains core of react
            react-dom.js file is needed to modify the DOM
        using npm
            npm i react 
            npm i react-dom
            add import statement like: import React from "react"
            script tags in html are browser scripts
            browser scripts can't have imports or exports
            so we give type="module" for script tags where have import/export statements
React.createElement
    creating elements is core thing in react, as this is used in native or others also
    parameters: tag name, attributes and children
    returns object that includes props etc.
    it does not return HTML
    children parameter
        can pass content/tag directly
        pass as array if we want to pass multiple children i.e. siblings
        must have key prop for each child in the array
*/

const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hello world from React Element"
);
// console.log(heading);
/* 
ouput:
object
*/

/*  
root node 
    it is used to display React components inside a browser DOM node
    react renders everything inside root
    we create root in DOM, so we use ReactDOM
*/
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

/*  
render 
    renders the react element in root node using render function 
    takes react element (Object) and converts it into HTML and adds to DOM
    it replaces content in root node with content we pass 
*/
root.render(heading);

/*
<div id="parent">
    <h2 id="child1"></h2>
    <h2 id="child2"></h2>
</div>
*/

const siblings = React.createElement("div", { id: "parent" }, [
  React.createElement("h2", { id: "child1",key:1 }, "child1"),
  React.createElement("h2", { id: "child2",key:2 }, "child2"),

    npm 
        manages packages
        not node package manager, it doesn't have a full form
    package.json 
        it is configuration for npm
    App dependencies
        normal dependencies
            required in development and production also
        dev dependencies
            required only in development phase
    caret(^) before version
        ^version “Compatible with version”
        will automatically update you to all future minor/patch versions that are backwards-compatible
        without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0
    tilde(~) before version
        ~version “Approximately equivalent to version”
        will automatically update you to all future patch versions that are backwards-compatible
        without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 1.3.0.
    node modules 
        contains app dependency packages
        and also dependencies of each packages so on
    package-lock.json
        it keeps record of exact version and other info of all the packages in node modules
    npm install 
        it will install every package inside package.json with exact version in package-lock.json
        so we can ignore the node modules folder while pushing code to github
    npx 
        we use npm to install the package
        npx is to execute or run the package
        ex: npx parcel index.html
    scripts in package.json
        create custom commands
        instead of using npx and command, npm run script_name
    browserslist package
        to suport older browsers
        added browserslist in package.json
    parcel
        it is a bundler like webpack
        it does
            dev build 
            local server
            HMR - Hot Module Replacement
                auto refresh page after saving file
            uses cache for faster builds 
            Image Optimization 
            Minification
            Compress files 
            Consistent hashing 
            Code splitting 
            Differential Bundling
                to support older browsers
            HTTPS
                can open the app in HTTPS instead of HTTP
            Tree shaking
                remove unused code 
            Different dev and prod bundles

/*  JSX
        HTML like syntax, it makes writing react code easy
        not part of React
        it is not valid Javascript
        it is transpiled by babel before it reaches JS Engine
        babel 
            converts JSX to React.createElement
            convert ES6+ Javascript to older browser understandable Javascript
        final output is an object, since React.createElement returns JS object
        html attributes are written in camelCase
        all tags in JSX are self closing tags
        inline css styles are provided as JS object in JSX
        multi line JSX must be wrapped with paranthesis ()
        can run Javascript expressions inside curly bracket {}
        React Element (js object) can be rendered by putting inside {}
        HTML => JSX
        class   className
        for     HTMLFor     
        if we added some malicious html/js, JSX won't run it
        React helps prevent injection attacks by automatically escaping any values embedded within JSX elements
        React converts all embedded values to strings before rendering them, effectively neutralizing potentially malicious code.

React Components 
    everything in react is a component

    Config-Driven UI    
        Config-driven UI is a design pattern where the structure and behaviour of the 
        user interface are defined using configuration files rather than hard-coded in the application. 
        passing the data according to config
        ex:passing food offers based on user location(city)
        
    props 
        aka properties
        passing prop to Functional Component is same as passing argument to a function.

    Optional chaining (?.)
        (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. 
        If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null, 
        the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

    key for children inside map 
        if a new child is added/removed in list, react doesn't know which one it is
        so react will re-render all list items
        if each child has an unique id, react will render just added child 
        Don't use index as key
            Suppose the parent component gets an array of 10 items and renders 10 components based on the array. 
            Suppose the 5th item is then removed from the array. On the next render the parent will receive 
            an array of 9 items and so React will render 9 components. 
            This will show up as the 10th component getting removed, instead of the 5th, 
            because React has no way of differentiating between the items based on index.
    
    exporting data 
        default export
            can only have 1 default export in a file
            can import it with any name, without {} 
        named export
            used to export multiple things in a file
            must use same name inside {}
        A module can contain both named exports and a default export, and they can be imported 
        together using import defaultExport, { namedExport1, namedExport3, etc... } from 'module';

    Conditional Rendering
        rendering based on conditions

    Standards
        don't keep hardcoded values inside Components
        keep them inside a config file ex:utils/constants.js
    
    Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)
        The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
        react creates a Virtual DOM (a representation of actual DOM)        
        it check difference btw old vDOM with new vDOM and then updates the actual DOM 


    React Hooks 
        Normal Javascript utility functions in React
        useState 
            creates state variables
            takes default value as an argument
            const for variables
                const prevents reassignment and we don't want to manipulate state directly 
                by reassigning it. We want to call the setter function to update state instead.
            we use setter method to update the state variable
            when state variable is updated
                react will re-render the component where that state variable is defined
                function component is called with new state value
                React does not update the const state variable
                const state variable is re-created with new value
            

        useEffect 
            it takes 2 arguments, callback function and a dependency array
            callback function will be called after component rendered
